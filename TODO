Any project must be worked with a basic layout of a final view.
This starts with description of the features. This features are then realized via endpoints.
The endpoints will then utilize clean architecture to build the whole app.

I have decided that I will stick to the monolith architecture for this build.
I will consider using different tech stack for this. For example, Redis. Provided, I will find a good use for it.
I would also keep in mind take care of 2 things:
1. This forum should be encompassing all features described in 01's forum main and optional projects. 
2. I should keep in mind extensibility. That means, then further should be extendable to **real-time forum**.

Now, to think, the project can be extendable to a social network. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Forum can be used as a basis for social network. But they are quite different in two major aspects.
    (1) Clear separation of backend from frontend. Means backend is simply a list of API endpoints.
    (2) Frontend uses a framework. So, it will vary drastically from things that are present here.
The forum can be used as a backbone for the social network, especially the database part. In other words,
you can use part of this forum and upcoming real-time forum for creating social network.

I might actually complete this forum and fork it in github, so I will basically keep extending it in
another repository.
