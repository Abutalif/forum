Alright, first things first, there is an issue. If I am launching this project from the root folder with something like "go run cmd/main", this sets the pivot point on root, so any code will be related to that location.

But if I decide to launch it from "cmd" folder, the error will occur, is it now asks for different location and pattern macthing will fail. Example:
abutalif@DESKTOP-8B6V3HQ:~/forum$ cd cmd/
abutalif@DESKTOP-8B6V3HQ:~/forum/cmd$ go run .
parse glob:  html/template: pattern matches no files: `./assets/templates/*.html`

This has to be fixed by telling some exact locations, independent of launch location.
